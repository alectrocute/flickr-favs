# flickr-favs
### Download & back up a user's Flickr favorites

`npm install`

 Then open favs.js and modify the strings under `CONFIGURATION`. You'll need an API key, the destination directory for the files and the desired user's Flickr ID, including the "@" sign.
 
 Then, to download a specific page, do:
 
`node favs.js 1`

You must do only a page at a time.
